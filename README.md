This repository contains the R markdown file of the project which when knitted will produce the PDF also included in this repository. The data used in this project is a CSV file named data.csv and contains the attributes for each song that were in the top 100 songs for each year from 1921 to 2020. It contains 169,000 songs. There are some duplicates which will be dealt with in my code.
